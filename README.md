## 🚀 Running the Agent

### Option 1: Using LangGraph Studio (Recommended)

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
langgraph dev
```

This will:
1. Start the LangGraph server on `http://127.0.0.1:2024`
2. Open LangGraph Studio in your browser
3. Enable hot-reloading for development

**LangGraph Studio URL:**
```
https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
```

#### Using Chat Mode

LangGraph Studio provides two interfaces:

**Chat Mode** - Simple conversational interface:
- Click the **"Chat"** tab at the top
- Clean chat interface for testing
- Real-time streaming responses
- Perfect for demos and quick testing

**Graph Mode** - Technical debugging view:
- Visual execution graph
- Node-by-node tracking
- State inspection
- Time travel debugging
- LangSmith integration

### Option 2: Using Python SDK

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_sync_client

client = get_sync_client(url="http://localhost:2024")

# Stream responses
for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    None,
    "linkedin_job_agent",
    input={
        "messages": [{
            "role": "human",
            "content": "Find me AI engineer jobs in San Francisco"
        }]
    },
    stream_mode="values"
):
    print(chunk)
```

### Option 3: Direct Python Execution

```bash
python linkedin_agent/agent.py
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Job Search (Real LinkedIn Jobs!)

```
User: Find me machine learning engineer jobs in New York

Agent: I'll search for machine learning engineer positions in New York for you.
[Searches LinkedIn and fetches REAL jobs...]
    
Found 15 LIVE jobs from LinkedIn:

1. Senior ML Engineer at OpenAI
   Location: New York, NY (Hybrid)
   Salary: $180k-$250k
   Posted: 2 days ago
   URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3789456123
   
2. Machine Learning Engineer at Google

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B[Agent Node]
    B --> C{Tool Call?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Tools Node]
    C -->|No| E[End]
    D --> F[Execute Tool]
    F --> B
```

### Key Components

1. **StateGraph**: Manages conversation state and job search context
2. **Agent Node**: Main reasoning node using LLM with tool binding
3. **Tools Node**: Executes tools (search, apply, generate cover letter)
4. **Conditional Edges**: Routes between agent and tools based on LLM decision

### Tools Available

| Tool | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `search_linkedin_jobs` | Search LinkedIn for real jobs | ✅ Live |
| `get_job_details` | Get detailed job information | ✅ Live |
| `generate_cover_letter` | Create personalized cover letter | ✅ Implemented |
| `apply_to_job` | Apply to a job posting | ⚙️ Stub (Ready to extend) |
| `update_user_preferences` | Save job search preferences | 📋 Available in tools.py |
| `analyze_job_match` | Match score for job fit | 📋 Available in tools.py |
| `find_referrals` | Find connections at companies | 📋 Available in tools.py |

## 🔧 Configuration

### langgraph.json

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "linkedin_job_agent": "./linkedin_agent/agent.py:graph"
  },
  "env": ".env"
}
```

### Customizing the Agent

**Change the LLM model:**

```python
# Use Claude Sonnet 4 (default)
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514", temperature=0)

# Or use Claude Opus 4.1 for more complex reasoning
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-opus-4-20250514", temperature=0)

# Or switch to OpenAI (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
```

**Change scraping method:**

```python
# Default: Public scraper (no auth)
from linkedin_agent.real_linkedin_scraper import LinkedInJobScraper
scraper = LinkedInJobScraper()

# Or use library method (more features)
# pip install linkedin-jobs-scraper
from linkedin_agent.real_linkedin_scraper import LinkedInJobsLibraryScraper
scraper = LinkedInJobsLibraryScraper()

# Or use API method (requires credentials)
# pip install linkedin-api
from linkedin_agent.real_linkedin_scraper import LinkedInAPIClient
scraper = LinkedInAPIClient()
```

**Add custom tools:**

```python
@tool
def my_custom_tool(param: str) -> dict:
    """Your tool description"""
    # Implementation
    return {"result": "success"}

# Add to tools list
tools = [search_linkedin_jobs, my_custom_tool]
```

**Modify system prompt:**

Edit the `SystemMessage` content in `agent_node()` function.

## 📊 Monitoring with LangSmith

Enable tracing to monitor agent performance:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_api_key
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=linkedin-job-agent
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - Add to `.gitignore`
2. **LinkedIn credentials** - Use environment variables only
3. **Rate limiting** - Implement to avoid account restrictions
4. **API quotas** - Monitor Anthropic/LLM usage
5. **User data** - Encrypt stored resumes and applications

## 🚧 Next Steps for Extension

The foundation is complete! Here are ideas for extending the agent:

### Job Application Automation
Currently stubbed - ready to implement with:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Graph not found" error
- ✅ Already configured in `langgraph.json`
- Check that file is in project root
- Verify the graph path matches: `./linkedin_agent/agent.py:graph`

### Import errors
- Activate virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.10+)

### LangGraph Studio not opening
- Ensure port 2024 is not in use
- Try `langgraph dev --port 8080`
- Check firewall settings

### No jobs found
- ✅ Real scraping is working
- LinkedIn may be rate-limiting
- Try broader search terms
- Add delay between searches
